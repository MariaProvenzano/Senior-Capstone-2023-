I will now dive further into the data set and give more information based on each variable compared to the type of country and economic status of developed or developing.

\newline

The average life expectancy when looking at the entire world is approximately 69 years old with a standard deviation of 9.41, a variance of 88.47, minimum life expectancy of approximately 39 years old and maximum life expectancy of approximately 84 years old.

The distribution of life expectancy in the data frame is skewed slightly to the right, however, when you look at the following data below, it is evident that there are many outliers in the data set which is causing this data to be skewed.

This cumulative frequency graph is a representation of the data points and what it would look like if we took smaller samples out from the original data set. The graph gives the probability of finding the life expectancy at a value less than or equal to the cut off of each value.

\bigskip 
The average life expectancy when looking only at developed countries is approximately 79 years old with a standard deviation of 3.16, a variance of 9.98, minimum life expectancy of 70 years old and maximum life expectancy of 84 years old. 

\smallskip
The average life expectancy when looking only at developing countries is approximately 66 years old with a standard deviation of 8.85, a variance of 78.33, minimum life expectancy of approximately 39 years old and maximum life expectancy of approximately of 83.

When only comparing the average life expectancy:
\bigskip
\newline

We can see that living in a developed country makes your life expectancy approximately 15 percent higher compared to the entire world.

We can see that living in a developing country makes your life expectancy approximately 4 percent lower compared to the entire world.

This plot shows just how different a personâ€™s life expectancy is biased on the factor whether or not their economy is developed. It demonstrates the difference between minimum value, maximum value, standard deviation, and variance while also showing how the average life expectancy is also significantly higher for those living in a developed country. 

<<fig = TRUE>>=

Based off this approximation, because the p-value (2.2e-16) is less than 0.05, we can say that these two variables, life expectancy and living in an economically developed or developing country are dependent upon each other.

\title{\bf Developed Verses Developing Countries Infant deaths}
\bigskip

We will now be looking at the number of Infant deaths per 1000 population that occur between developed and developing countries and how they differ. 
\smallskip 

From the information below, we can see that the worlds average number of infant deaths is 30 from 2000- 2015, with a high variance and standard deviation. 
<<>>=
avg.inft.death<-mean(df$Infaint.deaths)

This also shows the relationship that while this graph is not linear or a perfect graph, it demonstrates why the the distribution curve is slightly skewed. 
\bigskip

The distribution of infant deaths in the data frame is skewed heavily to the left, however, when you look at the following data below, it is evident that there are many outliers within the data set which could be causing this data to be skewed.

\newpage
The most concerning information you can see is when comparing infant deaths between developed verses developing countries all statistics shown below are drastically different. Meaning, there is a much higher risk of infant deaths in a developing economies / countries. The over all mean more developed is approximately 4 while developing is approximately 37. The variance of developed is approximately 6 while developing is 738. This just shows the wide range and inconsistency that comes along with living in a developing country when it comes to infant deaths.

When only comparing the average Infant deaths:
\newline
\smallskip
We can see that living in a developed country, infant deaths are down approximately 84 percent compared to the whole world.

\newpage
The box plot below demonstrates the large variance, standard deviation, and drastic difference between developed and developing countries when comparing infant deaths.
\bigskip

While there is not a statistic biased on health care availability in this data set, we can assume that developed countries have more access to health care and treatments, which also help eliminate or treat factors such as deformities, infections, diseases, and viruses. This is just one hypothetical reasing as to why there is an increase of infaint deaths in developing contries compared to the entire world.  

<<fig = TRUE>>=
boxplot(df$Infaint.deaths ~ df$Economy.status.developed)
@
\bigskip

To show how the infant death average is affecting the average life expectancy across the whole world, we can test its independence. 
<<>>=
table2 = table(df$Life.expectancy, df$Infaint.deaths)
chisq.test(table2)
@
\bigskip 
Based off this approximation, because the p-value is less than 0.05, we can say that these two variables are dependent upon each other. The rate of infant deaths is affecting the life expectancy average thus meaning there is correlation between the two variables.

\title{\bf Developed Verses Developing Countries Adult Mortality}
\bigskip

We will now be looking at the number of adult deaths per 1000 population that occur between developed and developing countries and how they differ. 
\smallskip 

From the information below, we can see that the worlds average number of adult deaths is approximately 192 people per 1000 population from 2000- 2015, with a high variance and standard deviation.

We can see that living in a developed country, adult mortality is down approximately 50 percent compared to the whole world.

@
\newpage
The box plot below demonstrates the large variance, standard deviation, and drastic difference between developed and developing countries. 

Same as stated before with Infant deaths, developed countries have more access to health care, immunizations, and vaccines, etc. This is a contributing factor as to why the adult mortality rate among developing countries is much higher because of the lack of resources and health care provided to its citizens. 

<<fig = TRUE>>=

This plot shows the relationship that while this graph is not linear or a perfect graph, it demonstrates that the distribution of this graph is curved and not bell shaped.  
\bigskip

 when you look at the data above, it is evident that there are many outliers within the data set which could be causing this data to be skewed.
\newpage
This cumulative frequency graph is a representation of the data points and what it would look like if we took smaller samples out from the original data set. The graph gives the probability of finding the life expectancy at a value less than or equal to the cut off of each value.

Based off this approximation, because the p-value (0.4337) is greater than 0.05, we can say that adult mortality and economy status developed or developing are independent upon each other.

\title{\bf Developed Verses Developing Countries and Diseases}


While anyone would assume that developing countries has a higher rate per population of contracting infections and diseases, and while it was the case for some of the diseases included in the data set, I wanted to bring attention to three of the diseases that took me by surprise that developed countries had the higher average of, this being Measles, Polio and Diphtheria. For space purposes, I decided to only show the one which as the most significant difference between the two results which is Measles. 
\bigskip
\newline

While this data is not overwhelming or alarming with the difference between developing and developed countries, the percentage of Measles in a developing country compared to the entire world is down 3 percent; while the percentage of Measles in a developed country compared to the entire world is up almost 14 percent. 
\newline 
This makes me wonder, in a developed country where we have more access to cleaner water, better health care, and more immunizations/ treatments; what is causes developed countries to be leading in more than half the infections/viruses/diseases provided in the data set.

This box plot shows the previous data and how the mean of developed is higher.

While the first graph is fairly normal, we can see that it is not fully finished all the way through, thus causing the distribution to be skewed. These two graphs show how skewed the representation of the data and how the outliers are affecting the overall results, finding and conclusions because it is not of a "normal" distribution of data.

It demonstrates the difference between minimum value, maximum value, standard deviation, and variance while also showing how the average years of schooling is  significantly higher for those living in a developed country.

Based off this approximation, because the p-value (2.2e-16) is less than 0.05, we can say that these two variables are dependent upon each other. Meaning that where you grow up, developed or developing country has an effect on your schooling overall.
